# 🎯 STM32 Sensor Fusion Robotic Arm Control (Real-Time Object Tracking)

This project implements embedded software and AI detection for a **5 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) robotic arm** controlled by an STM32F407 microcontroller. The goal is to enable the arm to autonomously **track** a designated object and **position itself** at a precise target distance using a **sensor fusion** approach.

I shared two versions, one made with functions and the other made with freeRTOS.

## 💡 Project Goal

The primary objective is to use **Image Processing (Camera)** data to lock the arm's horizontal (Pan) and vertical (Tilt) axes onto the target, while simultaneously using data from an **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor** to control the arm's reach (Proximity) to maintain a fixed distance (e.g., 5 cm) from the object.

## ✨ Key Control Mechanisms

The control is executed in the main loop using **non-blocking, step-by-step** functions with interrupts that continuously adjust the servo angles based on error feedback.
* **Primary Goal**	To autonomously lock the arm onto a target using Vision (DX/DY) and maintain a set distance using Ultrasonic Sensor data.	STM32F4, Raspberry Pi 5
* **Control Type**	Incremental (Step-by-Step) control. Movement speed is proportional to the error magnitude. C Language (STM32)
* **Vision Role**	Runs Python/YOLOv8n to detect the target, calculate DX/DY coordinates, and transmit them via UART.	Raspberry Pi 5
* **Control Role**	Consumes DX/DY and raw distance data to generate precise PWM signals for the servos.	STM32F407VGT6

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

* **Control Type:** Incremental movement control (smooth stepping). Movement speed scales with the size of the error.
* **Input:** Camera (Receiving DX, DY coordinates via UART) and Ultrasonic Sensor (TIM Input Capture).
* **Output:** PWM control for the Servo motors.
* **Software:** Developed using C and Python languages also with STM32 HAL Drivers.

## 🛠️ Hardware and Tools Used

This project involves a sensor fusion architecture, utilizing the processing power of a single-board computer for vision and a microcontroller for precise motor control. 

* **Microcontroller:** **STM32F407VGT6** Development Board (Handles PWM generation and Ultrasonic timing).
* **Vision Processing Unit (VPU):** **Raspberry Pi 5** (Used for running the vision algorithm, detecting the object via yolov8n.pt, and sending the processed DX/DY coordinates to the STM32 via UART/Serial Communication).
* **Actuators (Servos):** **6x MG996R** Metal Gear Servos (Used for moving the joints of the robotic arm).
* **Camera Input:** **1x USB Camera** (Provides the visual feed to the Raspberry Pi for object detection).
* **Distance Sensor:** **1x HC-SR04** Ultrasonic Sensor (Provides real-time distance measurements for the proximity control of Servo 5).
* **Interface:** **1x Logic Level Converter** (Essential for safe communication between the 3.3V STM32/Raspberry Pi logic and other components, if needed, or specifically for connecting the Raspberry Pi (1.8V/3.3V) to 5V servos or sensors if not directly compatible).
